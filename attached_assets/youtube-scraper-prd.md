# YouTube Channel Analytics Scraper - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
The YouTube Channel Analytics Scraper is a data extraction tool designed to collect comprehensive information from YouTube channels for analytical purposes. The application will allow users to input a YouTube channel URL and a specific time frame, then extract detailed metrics and content information that can be used for further analysis.

## 2. Goals and Objectives
- Create a reliable tool that extracts comprehensive YouTube channel and video data
- Provide flexibility in specifying date ranges for data collection
- Ensure compliance with YouTube's Terms of Service and API usage policies
- Generate structured output suitable for data analysis
- Implement proper error handling and rate limiting management

## 3. Target Users
- Content creators analyzing competitor channels
- Marketing analysts tracking performance metrics
- Researchers studying content trends and audience engagement
- Data analysts requiring YouTube data for visualization or reporting

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 User Input
- **Channel URL Input**: Accept a valid YouTube channel URL
- **Date Range Selection**: Allow users to specify a start and end date for data collection
- **Output Format Selection**: Let users choose between CSV, JSON, or Excel format for data export

### 4.2 Data Collection
The application must collect the following data points:

#### 4.2.1 Channel-level Data
- Channel name
- Channel description
- Total subscriber count (current)
- Total view count
- Channel creation date
- Channel category/tags
- Upload frequency (calculated)
- Channel thumbnail/banner URLs

#### 4.2.2 Video-level Data (for each video in the specified time range)
- Video title
- Video description
- Upload date and time (in UTC and user's local timezone)
- Video duration
- View count
- Like count
- Comment count
- All comments with timestamps (if possible, based on API limitations)
- Tags assigned to the video
- Video category
- Thumbnail URLs
- Video URL
- Video status (public, unlisted, etc.)
- Video quality options
- Description links

#### 4.2.3 Time-series Data (where available)
- View count progression (if accessible)
- Engagement metrics over time

### 4.3 Data Processing
- Parse all collected data into structured format
- Handle missing data points gracefully
- Calculate derived metrics:
  - Engagement rate (likes + comments / views)
  - Average view duration (if available)
  - Growth rates (where applicable)

### 4.4 Output Generation
- Generate CSV, JSON, or Excel files with all collected data
- Create separate files for channel-level and video-level data
- Include timestamp of data collection in filename
- Option to generate basic visualization of key metrics

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1 Authentication and API Usage
- Implement YouTube Data API v3 authentication
- Include clear setup instructions for API credentials
- Implement proper rate limit handling and backoff strategies
- Store API credentials securely

### 5.2 Error Handling
- Validate user inputs before processing
- Handle network errors and retry logic
- Provide clear error messages for issues like:
  - Invalid channel URL
  - API quota exceeded
  - Network connectivity problems
  - Authentication failures

### 5.3 Performance Considerations
- Implement pagination for handling large channels
- Use asynchronous processing where beneficial
- Include progress indicators for long-running operations
- Cache data when appropriate to minimize API calls

### 5.4 Alternative Scraping Methods
- Implement fallback methods for data points not available via API
- Consider ethical web scraping techniques where applicable and compliant with YouTube's Terms of Service

## 6. Limitations and Constraints

### 6.1 Known API Limitations
- YouTube API does not provide dislike counts (removed in late 2021)
- Daily subscriber change data is not directly available
- Comment retrieval may be limited by API quotas
- Historical view count data may be limited
- API quotas limit the number of requests per day

### 6.2 Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Must comply with YouTube's Terms of Service
- Should respect rate limits and not overload servers
- Should not circumvent any intentional API limitations
- Must include appropriate disclaimers about data usage

## 7. Implementation Approach

### 7.1 Recommended Libraries
- `google-api-python-client`: For YouTube Data API interactions
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `requests`: For any HTTP requests not covered by the API client
- `beautifulsoup4`: For parsing HTML content when needed
- `tqdm`: For progress bars
- `openpyxl`: For Excel file generation
- `matplotlib` or `plotly`: For basic data visualization

### 7.2 Core Components
1. **Authentication Module**: Handles API keys and OAuth2 setup
2. **Channel Data Collector**: Extracts channel-level metrics
3. **Video Listing Module**: Gets all videos within date range
4. **Video Detail Collector**: Retrieves detailed information for each video
5. **Comment Extractor**: Gets comments for videos (with pagination)
6. **Data Processor**: Structures and organizes collected data
7. **Export Module**: Generates output files in selected format

### 7.3 Implementation Steps
1. Set up API authentication
2. Validate channel URL and convert to channel ID if needed
3. Collect channel metadata
4. Retrieve video list filtered by date range
5. For each video, collect detailed metrics and metadata
6. For each video, collect comments (subject to quota limitations)
7. Process and structure all collected data
8. Generate output files
9. Provide summary report of collection statistics

## 8. Future Enhancements
- Integration with data visualization tools
- Scheduled data collection for tracking changes over time
- Comparative analysis between multiple channels
- Natural language processing of comments and descriptions
- Sentiment analysis of comments
- Topic modeling and content categorization
- Export to database options (SQL, MongoDB)

## 9. Acceptance Criteria
- Application successfully authenticates with YouTube API
- All specified data points are collected when available
- Date filtering works correctly
- Output files contain all collected data in a structured format
- Error handling works as expected
- Documentation clearly explains setup and usage
- Code is well-structured and maintainable

## 10. Setup and Usage Instructions
The implementation should include clear instructions for:
- Installing required dependencies
- Setting up API credentials
- Running the application
- Interpreting the output
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Understanding API quota limitations

## 11. Rate Limiting and Quota Management
The implementation must include strategies for:
- Staying within daily API quotas
- Implementing exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Caching results to minimize API calls
- Resuming interrupted operations
