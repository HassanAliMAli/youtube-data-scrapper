Both countries marked 30 years of diplomatic ties last year. Belarus\u2019s prime minister visited Islamabad in October 2024 to meet key Pakistani civilian and military officials to bolster economic cooperation. \n\nKhan arrived in Minsk on an official two-day visit to the country on Thursday.

He is the reigning Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion and the current silver medalist in the World Athletics Championship. His 92.97 metres (305.0 ft) throw at the 2024 Summer Olympics is an Olympic and Asian record and also the sixth longest throw in the history of javelin throw, when considering only the best throw from each athlete.\n\nHe is a two-time Olympian, and the first Pakistani to qualify for the final of any track and field event at the Olympic Games[8] and the World Athletics Championships.\n\nAt the 2022 Commonwealth Games, he set a new national and Commonwealth Games record with a throw of 90.18 m (295.9 ft) and became the first athlete from South Asia to breach the 90 m mark.[10] In the 2023 World Athletics Championships, he became the first Pakistani athlete to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships, a silver. He represents the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in the National Games of Pakistan.\n\nEarly life\n\nArshad Nadeem was born into a Punjabi Muslim family in Mian Channu, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The family belongs to the Jat community. He is the third-oldest among eight siblings. Nadeem was an exceptionally versatile athlete from his early school years. Though he dabbled in all the sports on offer in his school \u2014 cricket, badminton, football and athletics \u2014 his passion was cricket, and he soon found himself playing it at district-level tape-ball tournaments.Upon entering grade seven in school, Nadeem caught the eye of Rasheed Ahmad Saqi during an athletics competition. Saqi had a history of developing sportspeople in the division, and began training Nadeem soon afterwards.\n\nBefore settling on javelin throw, Nadeem also pursued shot put and discus throw. Gold medals in the javelin throw in successive Punjab Youth Festivals and an inter-board meet propelled him on to the national stage, bringing offers from all the leading domestic departmental teams, including the athletics sections of the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).[18] It was his father, Muhammad Ashraf, who persuaded him to take up the sport of javelin throwing.[20] Nadeem actually aspired to become a full-time cricketer, but he changed his mind and shifted his focus to athletics as he first picked up the javelin in 2015; Nadeem himself acknowledged that it was \"the best thing that happened\" to him.\n\n2022 Islamic Games: Gold medal\nFive days later, on 12 August 2022, Nadeem won another gold medal for Pakistan at the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games. He broke the games record with his throw of 88.55 m.\n\nIn November 2022, Nadeem won the gold medal in the javelin throw, with a toss of 81.21 m, at the 50th National Athletics Championship in Lahore.[48]\n\nElbow and knee injury (Late 2022)\nNadeem left for the UK on 1 December 2022 to get treatment on his injured elbow and knee joint. The AFP arranged for him to be treated at Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital. After a ten-day rehabilitation and physiotherapy period, full recovery took a further four to six weeks.\n\n2023 Pakistan National Games and knee injury\nIn May 2023, Nadeem participated in the 34th National Games of Pakistan and won a gold medal with the longest throw of 78.02 m during his third attempt, while representing WAPDA. However, he suffered a knee injury, which ruled him out of the Asian Athletics Championships. \n\n2023 World Athletics Championships: Silver medal\nNadeem won a silver medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest with a throw of 87.82 m. He also secured qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics during the event.\n\n2024 Paris Diamond League\nIn July 2024, Nadeem finished in fourth place in the Paris Diamond League with a 84.21m throw on his fifth attempt.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Gold medal and Olympic record\nAt the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Nadeem became the first Pakistani to win an Olympic medal in Athletics, by winning an Olympic gold medal. He is also the first Pakistani athlete to win an Olympic gold medal for an individual sport.

He is the reigning Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion and the current silver medalist in the World Athletics Championship. His 92.97 metres (305.0 ft) throw at the 2024 Summer Olympics is an Olympic and Asian record and also the sixth longest throw in the history of javelin throw, when considering only the best throw from each athlete.\n\nHe is a two-time Olympian, and the first Pakistani to qualify for the final of any track and field event at the Olympic Games[8] and the World Athletics Championships.\n\nAt the 2022 Commonwealth Games, he set a new national and Commonwealth Games record with a throw of 90.18 m (295.9 ft) and became the first athlete from South Asia to breach the 90 m mark.[10] In the 2023 World Athletics Championships, he became the first Pakistani athlete to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships, a silver. He represents the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in the National Games of Pakistan.\n\nEarly life\n\nArshad Nadeem was born into a Punjabi Muslim family in Mian Channu, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The family belongs to the Jat community. He is the third-oldest among eight siblings. Nadeem was an exceptionally versatile athlete from his early school years. Though he dabbled in all the sports on offer in his school \u2014 cricket, badminton, football and athletics \u2014 his passion was cricket, and he soon found himself playing it at district-level tape-ball tournaments.Upon entering grade seven in school, Nadeem caught the eye of Rasheed Ahmad Saqi during an athletics competition. Saqi had a history of developing sportspeople in the division, and began training Nadeem soon afterwards.\n\nBefore settling on javelin throw, Nadeem also pursued shot put and discus throw. Gold medals in the javelin throw in successive Punjab Youth Festivals and an inter-board meet propelled him on to the national stage, bringing offers from all the leading domestic departmental teams, including the athletics sections of the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).[18] It was his father, Muhammad Ashraf, who persuaded him to take up the sport of javelin throwing.[20] Nadeem actually aspired to become a full-time cricketer, but he changed his mind and shifted his focus to athletics as he first picked up the javelin in 2015; Nadeem himself acknowledged that it was \"the best thing that happened\" to him.\n\n2022 Islamic Games: Gold medal\nFive days later, on 12 August 2022, Nadeem won another gold medal for Pakistan at the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games. He broke the games record with his throw of 88.55 m.\n\nIn November 2022, Nadeem won the gold medal in the javelin throw, with a toss of 81.21 m, at the 50th National Athletics Championship in Lahore.[48]\n\nElbow and knee injury (Late 2022)\nNadeem left for the UK on 1 December 2022 to get treatment on his injured elbow and knee joint. The AFP arranged for him to be treated at Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital. After a ten-day rehabilitation and physiotherapy period, full recovery took a further four to six weeks.\n\n2023 Pakistan National Games and knee injury\nIn May 2023, Nadeem participated in the 34th National Games of Pakistan and won a gold medal with the longest throw of 78.02 m during his third attempt, while representing WAPDA. However, he suffered a knee injury, which ruled him out of the Asian Athletics Championships. \n\n2023 World Athletics Championships: Silver medal\nNadeem won a silver medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest with a throw of 87.82 m. He also secured qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics during the event.\n\n2024 Paris Diamond League\nIn July 2024, Nadeem finished in fourth place in the Paris Diamond League with a 84.21m throw on his fifth attempt.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Gold medal and Olympic record\nAt the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Nadeem became the first Pakistani to win an Olympic medal in Athletics, by winning an Olympic gold medal. He is also the first Pakistani athlete to win an Olympic gold medal for an individual sport. He not only claimed the men's javelin throw title but set a new Olympic record of 92.97 m in the final.[58] The previous Olympic record holder was Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen, who achieved 90.57 m at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nPersonal life\nArshad Nadeem is married and has a daughter and a son. He is a devout Muslim. Nadeem describes himself as an introvert.

He is the reigning Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion and the current silver medalist in the World Athletics Championship. His 92.97 metres (305.0 ft) throw at the 2024 Summer Olympics is an Olympic and Asian record and also the sixth longest throw in the history of javelin throw, when considering only the best throw from each athlete.\n\nHe is a two-time Olympian, and the first Pakistani to qualify for the final of any track and field event at the Olympic Games[8] and the World Athletics Championships.\n\nAt the 2022 Commonwealth Games, he set a new national and Commonwealth Games record with a throw of 90.18 m (295.9 ft) and became the first athlete from South Asia to breach the 90 m mark.[10] In the 2023 World Athletics Championships, he became the first Pakistani athlete to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships, a silver. He represents the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in the National Games of Pakistan.\n\nEarly life\n\nArshad Nadeem was born into a Punjabi Muslim family in Mian Channu, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The family belongs to the Jat community. He is the third-oldest among eight siblings. Nadeem was an exceptionally versatile athlete from his early school years. Though he dabbled in all the sports on offer in his school \u2014 cricket, badminton, football and athletics \u2014 his passion was cricket, and he soon found himself playing it at district-level tape-ball tournaments.Upon entering grade seven in school, Nadeem caught the eye of Rasheed Ahmad Saqi during an athletics competition. Saqi had a history of developing sportspeople in the division, and began training Nadeem soon afterwards.\n\nBefore settling on javelin throw, Nadeem also pursued shot put and discus throw. Gold medals in the javelin throw in successive Punjab Youth Festivals and an inter-board meet propelled him on to the national stage, bringing offers from all the leading domestic departmental teams, including the athletics sections of the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).[18] It was his father, Muhammad Ashraf, who persuaded him to take up the sport of javelin throwing.[20] Nadeem actually aspired to become a full-time cricketer, but he changed his mind and shifted his focus to athletics as he first picked up the javelin in 2015; Nadeem himself acknowledged that it was \"the best thing that happened\" to him.\n\n2022 Islamic Games: Gold medal\nFive days later, on 12 August 2022, Nadeem won another gold medal for Pakistan at the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games. He broke the games record with his throw of 88.55 m.\n\nIn November 2022, Nadeem won the gold medal in the javelin throw, with a toss of 81.21 m, at the 50th National Athletics Championship in Lahore.[48]\n\nElbow and knee injury (Late 2022)\nNadeem left for the UK on 1 December 2022 to get treatment on his injured elbow and knee joint. The AFP arranged for him to be treated at Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital. After a ten-day rehabilitation and physiotherapy period, full recovery took a further four to six weeks.\n\n2023 Pakistan National Games and knee injury\nIn May 2023, Nadeem participated in the 34th National Games of Pakistan and won a gold medal with the longest throw of 78.02 m during his third attempt, while representing WAPDA. However, he suffered a knee injury, which ruled him out of the Asian Athletics Championships. \n\n2023 World Athletics Championships: Silver medal\nNadeem won a silver medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest with a throw of 87.82 m. He also secured qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics during the event.\n\n2024 Paris Diamond League\nIn July 2024, Nadeem finished in fourth place in the Paris Diamond League with a 84.21m throw on his fifth attempt.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Gold medal and Olympic record\nAt the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Nadeem became the first Pakistani to win an Olympic medal in Athletics, by winning an Olympic gold medal. He is also the first Pakistani athlete to win an Olympic gold medal for an individual sport. He not only claimed the men's javelin throw title but set a new Olympic record of 92.97 m in the final.[58] The previous Olympic record holder was Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen, who achieved 90.57 m at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nPersonal life\nArshad Nadeem is married and has a daughter and a son. He is a devout Muslim. Nadeem describes himself as an introvert. His coach, Salman Iqbal Butt, a former national-level discus thrower, remembered him as a very respectful and obedient athlete who bowed his head as he listened to his coach's words.", "published_at": "2025-04-03T08:00:06Z", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7y0AtfojN70/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": "PT9M47S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": false, "licensed_content": true, "projection": "rectangular", "view_count": 256, "like_count": 1, "comment_count": 0, "tags": ["arshad nadeem", "neeraj chopra vs arshad nadeem", "arshad nadeem gold medal", "arshad nadeem olympics 2024", "arshad nadeem vs neeraj chopra", "arshad nadeem live", "arshad nadeem throw", "arshad nadeem interview", "arshad nadeem paris 2024 live", "arshad nadeem final", "arshad nadeem olympics", "arshad nadeem javelin throw", "arshad nadeem javelin throw 2024", "arshad nadeem wife", "arshad nadeem pakistan", "arshad nadeem paris 2024", "arshad nadeem final 2024", "arshad nadeem 92.97 throw"], "category_id": "25", "live_broadcast_content": "none", "default_language": "en", "localized": {"title": "What Challenges Did Arshad Nadeem Face on His Path to Success? | Zor Ka Jor", "description": "#samaatv #sawerapasha #cricket #zorkajor #sawerapasha #Nadeemarshad  #mnadeem #arshadnadeem #arshadnadeemgoldmedal #arshadnadeemwins #arshadnadeemolympics \n\nWhat Challenges Did Arshad Nadeem Face on His Path to Success? | Zor Ka Jor\n\nWho is Arshad Nadeem? \n\nArshad Nadeem PP HI is a Pakistani javelin thrower.

He is the reigning Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion and the current silver medalist in the World Athletics Championship. His 92.97 metres (305.0 ft) throw at the 2024 Summer Olympics is an Olympic and Asian record and also the sixth longest throw in the history of javelin throw, when considering only the best throw from each athlete.\n\nHe is a two-time Olympian, and the first Pakistani to qualify for the final of any track and field event at the Olympic Games[8] and the World Athletics Championships.\n\nAt the 2022 Commonwealth Games, he set a new national and Commonwealth Games record with a throw of 90.18 m (295.9 ft) and became the first athlete from South Asia to breach the 90 m mark.[10] In the 2023 World Athletics Championships, he became the first Pakistani athlete to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships, a silver. He represents the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in the National Games of Pakistan.\n\nEarly life\n\nArshad Nadeem was born into a Punjabi Muslim family in Mian Channu, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The family belongs to the Jat community. He is the third-oldest among eight siblings. Nadeem was an exceptionally versatile athlete from his early school years. Though he dabbled in all the sports on offer in his school \u2014 cricket, badminton, football and athletics \u2014 his passion was cricket, and he soon found himself playing it at district-level tape-ball tournaments.Upon entering grade seven in school, Nadeem caught the eye of Rasheed Ahmad Saqi during an athletics competition. Saqi had a history of developing sportspeople in the division, and began training Nadeem soon afterwards.\n\nBefore settling on javelin throw, Nadeem also pursued shot put and discus throw. Gold medals in the javelin throw in successive Punjab Youth Festivals and an inter-board meet propelled him on to the national stage, bringing offers from all the leading domestic departmental teams, including the athletics sections of the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).[18] It was his father, Muhammad Ashraf, who persuaded him to take up the sport of javelin throwing.[20] Nadeem actually aspired to become a full-time cricketer, but he changed his mind and shifted his focus to athletics as he first picked up the javelin in 2015; Nadeem himself acknowledged that it was \"the best thing that happened\" to him.\n\n2022 Islamic Games: Gold medal\nFive days later, on 12 August 2022, Nadeem won another gold medal for Pakistan at the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games. He broke the games record with his throw of 88.55 m.\n\nIn November 2022, Nadeem won the gold medal in the javelin throw, with a toss of 81.21 m, at the 50th National Athletics Championship in Lahore.[48]\n\nElbow and knee injury (Late 2022)\nNadeem left for the UK on 1 December 2022 to get treatment on his injured elbow and knee joint. The AFP arranged for him to be treated at Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital. After a ten-day rehabilitation and physiotherapy period, full recovery took a further four to six weeks.\n\n2023 Pakistan National Games and knee injury\nIn May 2023, Nadeem participated in the 34th National Games of Pakistan and won a gold medal with the longest throw of 78.02 m during his third attempt, while representing WAPDA. However, he suffered a knee injury, which ruled him out of the Asian Athletics Championships. \n\n2023 World Athletics Championships: Silver medal\nNadeem won a silver medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest with a throw of 87.82 m. He also secured qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics during the event.\n\n2024 Paris Diamond League\nIn July 2024, Nadeem finished in fourth place in the Paris Diamond League with a 84.21m throw on his fifth attempt.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Gold medal and Olympic record\nAt the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Nadeem became the first Pakistani to win an Olympic medal in Athletics, by winning an Olympic gold medal. He is also the first Pakistani athlete to win an Olympic gold medal for an individual sport. He not only claimed the men's javelin throw title but set a new Olympic record of 92.97 m in the final.[58] The previous Olympic record holder was Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen, who achieved 90.57 m at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nPersonal life\nArshad Nadeem is married and has a daughter and a son. He is a devout Muslim. Nadeem describes himself as an introvert. His coach, Salman Iqbal Butt, a former national-level discus thrower, remembered him as a very respectful and obedient athlete who bowed his head as he listened to his coach's words.", "published_at": "2025-04-03T07:30:06Z", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EmK6A_gq22o/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": "PT17M13S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": false, "licensed_content": true, "projection": "rectangular", "view_count": 363, "like_count": 9, "comment_count": 0, "tags": ["arshad nadeem", "neeraj chopra vs arshad nadeem", "arshad nadeem gold medal", "arshad nadeem olympics 2024", "arshad nadeem vs neeraj chopra", "arshad nadeem live", "arshad nadeem throw", "arshad nadeem interview", "arshad nadeem paris 2024 live", "arshad nadeem final", "arshad nadeem olympics", "arshad nadeem javelin throw", "arshad nadeem javelin throw 2024", "arshad nadeem wife", "arshad nadeem pakistan", "arshad nadeem paris 2024", "arshad nadeem final 2024", "arshad nadeem 92.97 throw"], "category_id": "25", "live_broadcast_content": "none", "default_language": "en", "localized": {"title": "The Success Story of Arshad Nadeem, Who Brought Glory to Pakistan | Zor Ka Jor", "description": "#samaatv #sawerapasha #cricket #zorkajor #sawerapasha #Nadeemarshad  #mnadeem #arshadnadeem #arshadnadeemgoldmedal #arshadnadeemwins #arshadnadeemolympics \n\nThe Success Story of Arshad Nadeem, Who Brought Glory to Pakistan | Zor Ka Jor\n\nWho is Arshad Nadeem? \n\nArshad Nadeem PP HI is a Pakistani javelin thrower.

Gold medals in the javelin throw in successive Punjab Youth Festivals and an inter-board meet propelled him on to the national stage, bringing offers from all the leading domestic departmental teams, including the athletics sections of the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).[18] It was his father, Muhammad Ashraf, who persuaded him to take up the sport of javelin throwing.[20] Nadeem actually aspired to become a full-time cricketer, but he changed his mind and shifted his focus to athletics as he first picked up the javelin in 2015; Nadeem himself acknowledged that it was \"the best thing that happened\" to him.\n\n2022 Islamic Games: Gold medal\nFive days later, on 12 August 2022, Nadeem won another gold medal for Pakistan at the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games. He broke the games record with his throw of 88.55 m.\n\nIn November 2022, Nadeem won the gold medal in the javelin throw, with a toss of 81.21 m, at the 50th National Athletics Championship in Lahore.[48]\n\nElbow and knee injury (Late 2022)\nNadeem left for the UK on 1 December 2022 to get treatment on his injured elbow and knee joint. The AFP arranged for him to be treated at Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital. After a ten-day rehabilitation and physiotherapy period, full recovery took a further four to six weeks.\n\n2023 Pakistan National Games and knee injury\nIn May 2023, Nadeem participated in the 34th National Games of Pakistan and won a gold medal with the longest throw of 78.02 m during his third attempt, while representing WAPDA. However, he suffered a knee injury, which ruled him out of the Asian Athletics Championships. \n\n2023 World Athletics Championships: Silver medal\nNadeem won a silver medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest with a throw of 87.82 m. He also secured qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics during the event.\n\n2024 Paris Diamond League\nIn July 2024, Nadeem finished in fourth place in the Paris Diamond League with a 84.21m throw on his fifth attempt.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Gold medal and Olympic record\nAt the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Nadeem became the first Pakistani to win an Olympic medal in Athletics, by winning an Olympic gold medal. He is also the first Pakistani athlete to win an Olympic gold medal for an individual sport. He not only claimed the men's javelin throw title but set a new Olympic record of 92.97 m in the final.[58] The previous Olympic record holder was Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen, who achieved 90.57 m at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nPersonal life\nArshad Nadeem is married and has a daughter and a son. He is a devout Muslim. Nadeem describes himself as an introvert. His coach, Salman Iqbal Butt, a former national-level discus thrower, remembered him as a very respectful and obedient athlete who bowed his head as he listened to his coach's words."}, "default_audio_language": "ur", "video_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmK6A_gq22o", "engagement_rate": 2.479338842975207, "description_urls": [], "comments": []}, {"id": "IlfqZSQ9r3Y", "title": "President Asif Ali Zardari Health !!

He is the reigning Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion and the current silver medalist in the World Athletics Championship. His 92.97 metres (305.0 ft) throw at the 2024 Summer Olympics is an Olympic and Asian record and also the sixth longest throw in the history of javelin throw, when considering only the best throw from each athlete.\n\nHe is a two-time Olympian, and the first Pakistani to qualify for the final of any track and field event at the Olympic Games[8] and the World Athletics Championships.\n\nAt the 2022 Commonwealth Games, he set a new national and Commonwealth Games record with a throw of 90.18 m (295.9 ft) and became the first athlete from South Asia to breach the 90 m mark.[10] In the 2023 World Athletics Championships, he became the first Pakistani athlete to win a medal at the World Athletics Championships, a silver. He represents the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) in the National Games of Pakistan.\n\nEarly life\n\nArshad Nadeem was born into a Punjabi Muslim family in Mian Channu, in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The family belongs to the Jat community. He is the third-oldest among eight siblings. Nadeem was an exceptionally versatile athlete from his early school years. Though he dabbled in all the sports on offer in his school \u2014 cricket, badminton, football and athletics \u2014 his passion was cricket, and he soon found himself playing it at district-level tape-ball tournaments.Upon entering grade seven in school, Nadeem caught the eye of Rasheed Ahmad Saqi during an athletics competition. Saqi had a history of developing sportspeople in the division, and began training Nadeem soon afterwards.\n\nBefore settling on javelin throw, Nadeem also pursued shot put and discus throw. Gold medals in the javelin throw in successive Punjab Youth Festivals and an inter-board meet propelled him on to the national stage, bringing offers from all the leading domestic departmental teams, including the athletics sections of the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).[18] It was his father, Muhammad Ashraf, who persuaded him to take up the sport of javelin throwing.[20] Nadeem actually aspired to become a full-time cricketer, but he changed his mind and shifted his focus to athletics as he first picked up the javelin in 2015; Nadeem himself acknowledged that it was \"the best thing that happened\" to him.\n\n2022 Islamic Games: Gold medal\nFive days later, on 12 August 2022, Nadeem won another gold medal for Pakistan at the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games. He broke the games record with his throw of 88.55 m.\n\nIn November 2022, Nadeem won the gold medal in the javelin throw, with a toss of 81.21 m, at the 50th National Athletics Championship in Lahore.[48]\n\nElbow and knee injury (Late 2022)\nNadeem left for the UK on 1 December 2022 to get treatment on his injured elbow and knee joint. The AFP arranged for him to be treated at Spire Cambridge Lea Hospital. After a ten-day rehabilitation and physiotherapy period, full recovery took a further four to six weeks.\n\n2023 Pakistan National Games and knee injury\nIn May 2023, Nadeem participated in the 34th National Games of Pakistan and won a gold medal with the longest throw of 78.02 m during his third attempt, while representing WAPDA. However, he suffered a knee injury, which ruled him out of the Asian Athletics Championships. \n\n2023 World Athletics Championships: Silver medal\nNadeem won a silver medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships in Budapest with a throw of 87.82 m. He also secured qualification for the 2024 Summer Olympics during the event.\n\n2024 Paris Diamond League\nIn July 2024, Nadeem finished in fourth place in the Paris Diamond League with a 84.21m throw on his fifth attempt.\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Gold medal and Olympic record\nAt the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Nadeem became the first Pakistani to win an Olympic medal in Athletics, by winning an Olympic gold medal. He is also the first Pakistani athlete to win an Olympic gold medal for an individual sport. He not only claimed the men's javelin throw title but set a new Olympic record of 92.97 m in the final.[58] The previous Olympic record holder was Norwegian Andreas Thorkildsen, who achieved 90.57 m at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nPersonal life\nArshad Nadeem is married and has a daughter and a son. He is a devout Muslim. Nadeem describes himself as an introvert. His coach, Salman Iqbal Butt, a former national-level discus thrower, remembered him as a very respectful and obedient athlete who bowed his head as he listened to his coach's words.", "published_at": "2025-04-02T14:00:16Z", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6gjz5b3kpHo/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": "PT35M38S", "dimension": "2d", "definition": "hd", "caption": false, "licensed_content": true, "projection": "rectangular", "view_count": 1127, "like_count": 12, "comment_count": 0, "tags": ["arshad nadeem", "neeraj chopra vs arshad nadeem", "arshad nadeem gold medal", "arshad nadeem olympics 2024", "arshad nadeem vs neeraj chopra", "arshad nadeem live", "arshad nadeem throw", "arshad nadeem interview", "arshad nadeem paris 2024 live", "arshad nadeem final", "arshad nadeem olympics", "arshad nadeem javelin throw", "arshad nadeem javelin throw 2024", "arshad nadeem wife", "arshad nadeem pakistan", "arshad nadeem paris 2024", "arshad nadeem final 2024", "arshad nadeem 92.97 throw"], "category_id": "25", "live_broadcast_content": "none", "default_language": "en", "localized": {"title": "Eid ul Fitr 2025 | Day 3 Special Transmission | Arshad Nadeem | Sawera Pasha | Zor Ka Jor", "description": "#samaatv #sawerapasha #cricket #zorkajor #sawerapasha #Nadeemarshad  #mnadeem #arshadnadeem #arshadnadeemgoldmedal #arshadnadeemwins #arshadnadeemolympics \n\nEid ul Fitr 2025 | Day 3 Special Transmission | Arshad Nadeem | Sawera Pasha | Zor Ka Jor \n\nWho is Arshad Nadeem? \n\nArshad Nadeem PP HI is a Pakistani javelin thrower.
