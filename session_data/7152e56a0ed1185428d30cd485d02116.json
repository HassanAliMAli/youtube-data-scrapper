Luke and Linus face off with a twist: they each have a $500 budget, but this time, they MUST water cool their rigs\u2026 using no off-the-shelf PC cooling gear. Junkyard radiators? Fish tank pumps? Soda bottle reservoirs?

I previously came from an iPhone 13 Pro. The battery was going so I decided to try android. The phone felt premium in my hand and was a good size and comfortable to hold even with the case the display was vivid clear and enjoyable to use. The camera, even though it was just an S 24 was pretty good. It took very clear sharp images and didn\u2019t do bad in lower light situations. I appreciate how much android allows you to customize and fine-tune the settings. I live in the Midwest where we don\u2019t have 5G coverage everywhere and I travel a lot further north for some reason when the phone switched to 4G LTE, even though I had 4 to 5 bars of service, the phone would act like it had no Internet connection at all, but I could still send text messages and phone calls. My iPhone never did that with the same carrier. It seemed like the phone had a lot of bloat apps on it multiple apps that did the same thing like Samsung pay and Google paste stacked on top of each other. I\u2019m not sure what it is with play store but it seems like I needed to update 10+ apps almost daily. The phone would have periods where it would get very warm and it would slow down a lot and start lagging making me have to restart it most of the time. The talk to text was absolutely atrocious, even if I spoke loudly and clearly it would slaughter most of the things I was saying I feel like it was trying to use too much grammar correction the battery life was OK as long as I wasn\u2019t using apps like YouTube or TikTok if I gained the battery would drain very quickly. I don\u2019t know those were just some of the issues I personally came across. I tried the phone for 3 1/2 months. I ended up going with a 16 pro max and having none of these issues. I\u2019m not saying the phone was horrible. That was just my personal experience. I never have these issues with my iPhone. It is always a smooth seamless experience every day no matter what task I\u2019m asking the phone to do it. Does everything quickly with no problems I think android just needs to work on their operating system. Everything else seems premium and nice. My experience with android though was pretty sloppy it just doesn\u2019t feel refined enough yet not for me at least", "like_count": 0, "published_at": "2025-04-06T10:41:03Z", "updated_at": "2025-04-06T10:42:50Z"}, {"author": "@EllisKaiXOXO", "text": "If i want to change a phone brand, i might consider changing the ecosystem. I cannot complain about how the new phone would not communicate well in my existing digital ecosystem. I hope these guys aren&#39;t a representation of typical iPhone users. And taking screenshots can be done by a swipe of a finger, back tap, side key press etc etc i would have probably done a research within the settings first before complaining - it&#39;s so simple you just have to think and change the settings accordingly. And do you think you would know how to navigate around iOS for the very first time you use it? Esp if you so got used to a single Android device? Would it make iOS not intuitive if you could not? And about the keyboard on the foldable - why not use the floating keyboard? It would have let him swype words and just use one hand or just use the mic omg such a basic task you don&#39;t have to go to school just to learn how to be resourceful.

I tracked the package, and it showed has delivered on that same day to someplace in my city\u2026but certainly not to my address. The USPS has a great system for tracking down mail pieces. I started a claim with USPS, and within a day they gave me the approximate package weight and which street it was delivered to. This was obviously not my package, as it was a letter envelope, and I had ordered apparel that would have shipped in a larger package. Also the street was nowhere near my address.<br>With this new information from USPS, I reopened my claim at PayPal. Less than a week later, PayPal has refunded my money.

THIS is why some people with low memory feel like windows is always sooo laggy.......When I went from 32g to 64g of memory suddenly windows was quick and snappy because no matter what I did I always had plenty of memory headroom so windows didn&#39;t compress anything.\r<br>\r<br>I have 64g 3200mhz DDR4..... 4 sticks..... and yes I know its low end dual ch mem and I have 4 sticks......well at the time it was high end LOL.......and I am also aware that 3600mhz is the sweet spot for DDR4........ well at the time 3600 was DOUBLE the price of 3200 so yea.......well I first ordered 32g and it never came... after calling the store they sent another kit....... like 6 weeks later the 1st kit that disappeared suddenly showed up......\r<br>\r<br>Anyways the point Is that today if you build a gaming PC I would shoot for 64g of memory\r<br>\r<br>.....

It feels like the &quot;this is it&quot; moment  for the tech industry. apparently another effect of the tech industry in all of this is that, according to journalists and political scientists around the world, they have been sounding of the decline of democracy all over the world, and the primary catalyst to that decline is the tech industry. The effects of social media and the internet in altering our way of thinking is affecting our institutions fundamentally whereas it is the reason for all the political division that has been happening all over the world. there is the part of billionaires owning all this platforms and their prioritized moneyed interest rather than thinking about people&#39;s safety by stopping all this misinformation and disinformation on the platforms. I implore you to watch Maria Ressa&#39;s interviews (nobel peace prize awardee). the tech industry is on the cusp of a fundamental change, not just in the technologies themselves but also how it is sold, manufactured and used. @linus, i hope you would read this.
