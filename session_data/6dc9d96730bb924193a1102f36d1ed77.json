If You enjoy this video please share this  video with your friend's and family members, and don't forget to subscribe To our YouTube channel!\n\nIs Devin AI really worth the $500/month price tag? In this video, we explore Cognition's new autonomous AI developer that's been making headlines in the tech world.\n\nDevin isn't just another AI coding assistant - it's a fully autonomous developer that takes complete control of your projects. Working through Slack and GitHub, it can understand your requirements and execute them independently, just like a human developer would.\n\nWhile early feedback has been mixed, with some developers calling it revolutionary and others expressing frustration, the most interesting part is the cost. At roughly $8/hour in compute units, it's significantly cheaper than human developers. But does it deliver?\n\nWe'll be testing Devin ourselves as soon as we get access to bring you the real story.

If You enjoy this video please share this  video with your friend's and family members, and don't forget to subscribe To our YouTube channel!\n\nIs Devin AI really worth the $500/month price tag? In this video, we explore Cognition's new autonomous AI developer that's been making headlines in the tech world.\n\nDevin isn't just another AI coding assistant - it's a fully autonomous developer that takes complete control of your projects. Working through Slack and GitHub, it can understand your requirements and execute them independently, just like a human developer would.\n\nWhile early feedback has been mixed, with some developers calling it revolutionary and others expressing frustration, the most interesting part is the cost. At roughly $8/hour in compute units, it's significantly cheaper than human developers. But does it deliver?\n\nWe'll be testing Devin ourselves as soon as we get access to bring you the real story. Stay tuned for our hands-on experience and honest assessment of whether this AI could really change the future of software development.\n\n#DevinAI #AISoftwareEngineer #SoftwareEngineering #CodingAutomation #AIAgent #AICoding #BuildSoftware #AIAgents #AppDevelopment #ArtificialIntelligence\n\nNote: Features and pricing mentioned are based on current public information and may change as the product develops\n\nI hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed making it.
